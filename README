Matlab function to open c3d files, made to be dependency-free and octave compatible.

open_c3d(file) returns the following structure :

├── analog
│   └── channellabel
│       └── [ frame, samples per frame ] (frame_number x samples)
├── coord
│   └── [ frame, points ]                (frame_number x 3*points_number)
├── noms
│   └── [ names ]                        (points_number)
└── point
    └── pointname
            └── [ frame, xyz ]           (frame_number x 3)


As of now it doesn't return the other properties although they are extracted and the function can easily be modified to return the groups variable.
